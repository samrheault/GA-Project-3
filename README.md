# GA-Project-3
Using train/test split, build a linear regression and KNN model based on the Boston housing data

## Project Objective

In this project, you'll build a linear regression (and KNN) model using guided prompts. You will be exposed to model validation using the train/test split (and K-Fold methods as a bonus) in order to fit different models on sample Boston housing data. 

This project includes **required** and **bonus** objectives. You only need to complete the **required** portions, but you're encouraged to try as many of the bonus questions as possible!

For this project, you will be:
  - Creating a train/test split of the data.
  - Training each of your models on the training data.
  - Evaluating each of the models on the test data.
  - Ranking models by how well they scored on the testing data set.
